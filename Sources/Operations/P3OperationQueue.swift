/**
 `OperationQueue` is a generalization of `OperationQueue` that works with
 instances of `Operation`.
 
 To use `OperationQueue` you just need to call its designated initializer.
 
 ```swift
 let queue = OperationQueue()
 ```
 
 Then, you can add instances of `Operation` or `Operation` to it using the `addOperation(_:)` method.
 
 ```swift
 let op = Operation()
 queue.addOperation(op)
 ```
 
 - Attention:
 
 `OperationQueue` can also be used as a singleton.
 
 ```swift
 OperationQueue.sharedQueue.addOperation(op)
 ```
